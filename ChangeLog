	makefile: add FASTER variable
	Increase the compile time of opensips by compiling all modules in parallel.

	Usage example: FASTER=1 make -j all

	* [176a41f] :

	Address concern: readability of compiling modules without -j.

	* [67cfefe] :

	Address concerns: clearly note that there was an error.


2014-03-19  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [9271a45] :

	Replace odd -j in module-submake with ability for proper parallelism.
	Recently `-j` was added to the list of flags passed to the modules
	$(MAKE) command. That's bad practise for two reasons: (1) the caller
	should decide on how much -j is required, not the programmer, and (2)
	just -j without any numeric argument is "use all resources you can
	get", which can be too much.

	We order the Makefile around so the supermake (the user invocation)
	can dispatch individual submakes in a parallel fashion. This is done
	by (a) making the module directories phony targets and (b) replacing
	the sequential for-loop over the modules with a simple dependency.


2014-03-19  Razvan Crainea  <razvan at opensips dot org>

2014-03-10  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f001f09] :

	Added support for multiple timer processes in TM. The timer process may easyly become a bottleneck in TM because: 	 (a) single lock on the timer lists, 	 (b) single process to purge/free all transactions, 	 (c) single process running all failure routes (with all script complexity of failure routes). This patch addresses all the above problems allowing multi-locking and multi-processing for the the overall timer concept in TM. Existing "own_timer_proc" module parameter extended from boolean value to an integer value : 0 - no separate timer proc for TM; 1 - one separate timer proc for TM; n - multiple timer procs for TM.

	This commit fixes a couple of presence issues (introduced in 80c48e6):
	 * There was a memory leak in dlginfo_agg_nbody.
	 * Bounds checking in dlginfo_agg_nbody was off by 4 (potential stack
	   corruption).

	   was needed at all: reduced to 1 optional one.
	 * Replace "dumy" with "dummy" in the vicinity.

2014-02-05  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [3b66855] :

	digest+m_auth: Allow a domain in the digest username.
	Before this patch, a domain in the digest username was allowed:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="domain"

	but only if the domain is equal to the realm. This was introduced in
	a92bf789 (Juha Heinanen, Mar. 29 2006).

	The SIP spec. doesn't mention any such restriction.

	This patch undoes that commit and makes sure the whole username is used
	when authenticating through `pv_www_authorize` and `pv_proxy_authorize`.
	That makes the following valid:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="something different"

	* [8c21659] :

	enable rabbitmq heartbeat to solve issues of hanging SIP processing because of a broken amqp socket
	This implementation enabled the rabbitmq's client side's heartbeat negotiation.

	Issue:
	Because of TCP's nature, it takes very long time for a TCP peer to make the decision of closing a local socket when the connection actually is broken. The event_rabbitmq module didn't handle the situation which causes the Opensips1.9 stop processing UDP packets until the O.S decides to close the local socket. One of the consequence is that UAC cannot register to the registrar during this time period.

	Issue Reproduce:
	1. Block an existing amqp connection from the rabbitmq-server that event_rabbitmq module connects to.
	2. From the event_rabbitmq side, the UDP receive-buffer that Opensips uses should be full.

	Solution:
	If the module, even_rabbitmq/rabbitmq-client, doesn't get a heartbeat message from the rabbitmq-server within X seconds, the rabbitmq-client will kill the local socket connection actively.

	Added a modparam:

	modparam("event_rabbitmq", "heartbeat", [X seconds]

	* [615a36e] :

	Merge pull request #73 from wdoekes/wjd-pua_min_expires_doc
	pua.c sets int min_expires= 300, not 0 as documentation states.


2013-09-20  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [7938941] :

	- fixed updating the index of the last DEL operation - this is essential for deciding which lumps must be skipped (as overlapping with delete parts of the message)   Credits go to Nick Altmann for reporting and helping with troubleshooting.   Closes issue #79


2013-09-17  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [c5a57a8] :

	Fix PUA module so that it sends a final PUBLISH on expiration.
	A final PUBLISH with expires=0 is now generated when a publication has
	expired. This will trigger the transmission of a final state NOTIFY.


2013-09-16  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [ba04cba] :

	Fix evi crash when defining more than 10 events


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [98330c7] :

	- UAC module does not load (no dependency) on UAC_AUTH if the uac_auth() function is not used. - UAC module does not load RR and DIALOG (with further dependencies on the params of those modules) if no FROM/TO replace ops are done.


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [99b233a] :

	- new functions added to help a module to check if its functions are used from the script (we cannot rely on the fixup functions as we have functions without parameters or need for fixup). Such function is needed for fixing dependencies between modules (to follow up)


2013-09-04  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [6f048e0] :

	Fix: allow rest_client functions in onreply_route
	Credits to Jayesh Nambiar for reporting


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [01db912] :

	- fixed CANCEL matching in B2B


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [bb2313d] :

	-  Gracefully detect if the uac_auth modules is available for usage in b2b_entities modules - do not through an error message but rather an info one, as find the uac_auth module is optional.


2013-09-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [ea44068] :

	- when starting the FR timer, it should not override any previous setting of a FR or FR_INV timers.   Solves Issue #25 (reported and troubleshooted by Mayama Takeshi) when a very fast 100 reply may stop retransmissions, but brake the updating of fr timer from FR to FR_INV state.


2013-09-03  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [ec82ef8] :

	- fixed how lumps can overlap on the edge - an "add" just next to a "delete"   Reported by Saul Ibarra Corretge   Closes issue #59


2013-09-03  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [6dd4b76] :

	* [31a7aa2] :

	Merge pull request #62 from dsandras/ds-dialoginfo-notifications-fixes
	Fixed RFC 4235 notifications compliance.


2013-09-03  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [515b790] :

	Added new dns_try_naptr option.
	The rationale behind this is that many stacks do not implement NAPTR
	correctly and rely only on DNS SRV. With misconfigured DNS servers, it
	can lead to useless lookups generating potentially long delays.

	This can now be disabled if not needed.


2013-09-03  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [b33d4b3] :

	Fix several usrloc named flag issues

	- fix DB contact update function to properly store the flags


2013-09-02  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [5a63dcd] :

	Fix replication of dialog delete events
	- instead of sending "deleted" packets based on hash delete operations,
	they are now sent when a dialog changes state to "DLG_STATE_DELETED"
	- this prevents the receiving instance from replicating the event again


2013-08-30  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [5e33750] :

	- fixed NULL sockets in external scenarios (this leads to crashing when building the contact hdr)   Reported by dexteruk on IRC .

	  DB queries

2013-08-28  Vlad Paiu  <vladpaiu at opensips dot org>
	* [18257f3] :

	Fixed bug introduced by previous commit : 	- downstream BYEs should go to 200OK leg in order to trigger dialog termination 	- upstream BYEs have no such limitation ( there's only one caller leg :) )


2013-08-28  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [78ff5db] :

	- proper backport of all changes from 1.8 branch


2013-08-27  liviuchircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [389de52] :

	Fix: also run child_init for bin listeners
	- bin listeners are now identified by the PROC_BIN rank
	- this way, only the UDP listeners receive positive ranks


2013-08-26  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f153a9a] :

	- BYE requests received in confirmed state should terminate the dialog only if they match the TO-tag from 200 OK INVITE.   This affects parallel forking scenarios where rejected branches are terminated via BYE by caller.   Thanks for reporting and testing to Marco Hierl.

2013-08-13  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [b4d0368] :

	PUBLISH requests are now handled in the same order than received.
	That is specifically useful for pua dialoginfo which was generating dialog
	info notifications that were handled in the wrong order with that patch.
	PUBLISH with older documents were sometimes treated after PUBLISH requests
	with newer documents, leading to incoherent states.
