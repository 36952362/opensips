	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
		The <emphasis>mid_registrar</emphasis> component of a VoIP platform is
		a registration front-end, an in-between SIP registrar.
		It opens up new possibilities for leveraging existing infrastructure
		in order to support larger user bases / heavier traffic loads while minimizing
		the need to add additional hardware. This is possible through the
		optimized SIP user location implementation of OpenSIPS, capable of handling high
		subscriber numbers and large amounts of registration traffic.
	</para>
	<para>
		The main motivation behind the mid-registrar concept
		stems from the fact that SIP User Agents have been (and still are!) continually shifting towards
		mobile devices. These UAs are known to have unstable network presence,
		hence they have short built-in registration times, imposed by their manufacturers
		(usually 60 seconds). This, in effect, causes them to put more and more
		registration traffic overhead on existing platforms.
	</para>
	<para>
		Acting as an intermediary registration front-end between users and main SIP registrar,
		the mid-registrar is able to:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para>
				convert incoming high-rate registration traffic into a low-rate variant,
				towards the main registrar layer. With proper configuration, it can
				absorb over 90% of existing registration traffic while
				preserving the back-end's user location state, effectively reducing
				resource usage at the respective layer.
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>
				stay in perfect sync with the registration back-end
				(from a SIP perspective), by properly adhering to the contact
				states and expiration times imposed by the main registrar
			</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<section id="sec-working-modes">
	<title>Working modes</title>
	<para>
		Depending on the value of the <emphasis><xref linkend="modparam-mode"/></emphasis>
		module parameter, the mid_registrar can function in one of the following ways:
	</para>

	<section id="sec-mirror-mode">
		<title>Mirror (default, mode = 0)</title>
		<para>
			This basic usage of the module highlights its capability to properly handle
			expiry times imposed by the main registrar layer.
			In other words, any contact-related operation will only be performed on a 200 OK reply.
		</para>
		<para>
			In "mirror mode", the mid-registrar will not alter any Contact or Expires header,
			nor append additional ones. It will not modify a REGISTER request at all.
		</para>
		<para>
			A possible usage of this mode, for example, would be to cache registrations in
			order to offload the main registrar from processing a subset of all
			types of incoming SIP requests.
		</para>

	</section>

	<section id="sec-device-throttling-mode">
		<title>Device throttling (mode = 1)</title>
		<para>
		This working mode employs a SIP contact-oriented approach (hence "device"),
		in which subsequent registration traffic is throttled (i.e. absorbed /
		immediately replied to / not forwarded to the main registrar) for each unique
		SIP "Contact" header field that manages to successfully register.
		</para>
		<para>
		Device throttling is the first level of registration traffic optimization. This
		is possible through the use of the
		<emphasis><xref linkend="modparam-outgoing-expires"/></emphasis> module
		parameter or the corresponding parameter to
		<emphasis><xref linkend="modfunc-mid-registrar-save"/></emphasis>,
		which allow the script writer to prolong the life of the registrations on the way
		to the main registrar.
		</para>
		<para>
		Once a prolonged registration is completed, subsequent registrations for the same
		SIP Contact header field value will be continuously absorbed by the mid-registrar
		until, eventually, the lifetime of the remote registration will have decreased
		enough that a refresh (i.e. simply forwarding the next REGISTER request) is mandatory.
		</para>
		<para>
		A common occurence is for some SIP User Agents to lose their network connection
		(especially when dealing with mobile devices), hence not de-registering themselves
		from the mid-registrar. In this case, in order to avoid zombie registrations on the
		main registrar (which contains SIP contacts with greatly extended lifetimes!),
		the mid-registrar will appropriately generate De-REGISTER requests and remove
		these contacts from the main registrar's location service as soon as it considers
		them to have expired.
		</para>
		<para>
			In "device throttling mode", depending on the "outgoing_expires" value, the
			mid-registrar may alter Contact header field values found in the initial request,
			including their ";expires" parameters, as needed. If an "Expires" header field
			is present, its value may also be altered. Finally, the module may also insert a "Path"
			header if the <emphasis>countact_routing_mode</emphasis> module parameter indicates
			this.
		</para>
		<para>
			Practical usages for this mode include the above "registration caching" concept,
			along with "traffic conversion". The latter does nothing more than to save
			resources on the back-end layer, allowing it to dedicate more processing power
			to critical areas of the platform, such as advanced SIP calling features and/or media handling.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="sec-user-throttling-mode">
		<title>User throttling (mode = 2)</title>
		<para>
			This working mode employs a SIP Address-of-record-oriented approach (hence "user"),
			in which subsequent registration traffic is throttled (i.e. absorbed /
			immediately replied to / not forwarded to the main registrar) for each unique
			SIP "To" header field username part that manages to successfully register.
		</para>
		<para>
			User-level throttling is the second level of registration traffic optimization,
			effectively building upon the previous "device throttling" mode. This
			is also possible through the use of the <emphasis>outgoing_expires</emphasis> module
			parameter or the corresponding parameter to
			<emphasis><xref linkend="modfunc-mid-registrar-save"/></emphasis>,
			which allow the script writer to prolong the life of the registrations on the way
			to the main registrar.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once a prolonged registration is completed, subsequent registrations to the same
			Address-of-record (the username of the "To" header field URI of a
			REGISTER request) will be continuously absorbed by the mid-registrar until,
			eventually, the lifetime of the remote registration will have decreased enough
			that a refresh (i.e. simply forwarding the next REGISTER request) is mandatory.
		</para>
		<para>
			A common occurence is for some SIP User Agents to lose their network connection
			(especially when dealing with mobile devices), hence not de-registering themselves
			from the mid-registrar. In this case, in order to avoid zombie registrations on the
			main registrar (which contains SIP contacts with greatly extended lifetimes!),
			the mid-registrar will appropriately generate De-REGISTER requests and remove
			these contacts from the main registrar's location service as soon as it considers
			them to have expired.
		</para>
		<para>
			Of all three modes, "user throttling" potentially offers the best reduction in
			traffic on the way to the main registrar. By aggregating contacts, it also
			has the added benefit of reducing the number of contacts that the main registrar
			must handle.
		</para>
		<para>
			Regarding SIP request mangling in this mode, the module will always
			replace all Contact header fields with a single Contact header
			field, for registration requests headed over to the
			main registrar, indicating that the AoR is local to the front-end,
			along with all of its contacts.
		</para>
		<para>
			Practical usages for this mode include the "registration caching" concept,
			along with "traffic conversion". The latter does nothing more than to save
			resources on the back-end layer, allowing it to dedicate even more processing power
			to critical areas of the platform, such as advanced SIP calling features and/or media handling.

	<section id="sec-contact-routing-modes">
	<title>Contact routing modes</title>
	<para>
		A defining feature of the module is that it must be easy to integrate,
		ideally a "plug-and-play" SIP component, without imposing any additional
		"outbound-proxy" configurations on any of the platform's layers.
	</para>
	<para>
		With the above in mind, the script writer can choose between two
		out-of-the-box contact routing mechanisms: either by having the module modify Contact
		headers when forwarding registrations, or instruct it to make use
		of a Path header (RFC 3327).
	</para>
	<section id="sec-contact-routing-by-contact">
		<title>Route by Contact (default, contact_routing_mode = 0)</title>
		<para>
			In this routing mode, the module will mangle the Contact header field values
			of all forwarded registration requests, by replacing any
			original IP and port of a Contact URI with those of one of the
			mid-registrar's listening interfaces.
		</para>
		<para>
			The module will also append a parameter to each Contact URI
			("rinstance" by default, can be changed through the
			<emphasis><xref linkend="modparam-contact-match-param"/></emphasis> module parameter)
			This URI parameter allows reply contacts to be matched with the
			ones from the request. This same parameter will also be used when
			routing calls to the users. In this case, it will be taken from
			the INVITE's Request-URI.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="sec-contact-routing-by-path">
		<title>Route by Path (contact_routing_mode = 1)</title>
		<para>
			Instructs the module to append a "Path" header field to each
			forwarded registration request. By recording itself between each
			user and the main registrar, the mid-registrar allows subsequent
			calls to be properly routed to the called party.
